# Entropies and Dimensions

## Entropies
In the study of dynamical systems there are many quantities that identify as "entropy".
Notice that these quantities are not the more commonly known
[thermodynamic ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy), used in Statistical Physics. Rather, they are more like the to the entropies of [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)), which represents
information contained within a dataset, or information about the dimensional
scaling of a dataset.

### Generalized Entropy
```@docs
genentropy
```
---
Basically, given a [dataset](system_definition/#numerical-data) you can
partition it into boxes to calculate an entropy.

!!! tip "Worried about memory overflow? Don't be!"
    Partitioning the dataset (i.e. doing a *histogram*) is in general a costly
    operation that depends exponentially on the number of dimensions of the data
    and algebraically to the box size `ε`.

    However, in this specific case the partition process has some special aspects
    that can be taken advantage
    of, reducing tremendously the memory allocation and spent time!


The function used internally by `genentropy` is `non0hist`:
```@docs
non0hist
```
---
For example, the Shannon entropy of a coin-flip process should be one bit,
[by definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_(unit)). Let's see...
```@example entropy
using DynamicalSystems
y = Float64.(rand(Bool, 1000000)) # just some coin tosses
sh = genentropy(1, 0.1, y)  # this is the shannon entropy
isapprox(sh, log(2),  rtol = 1e-4)
```
Because all entropies are by default calculated on base-$e$, the unit of measurement is "nat" and one bit is $\log(2)\times$nat.

### Permutation Entropy
The permutation entropy is introduced by C. Bandt and B. Pompe as a
"A Natural Complexity Measure for Timeseries", which directly applies to arbitrary real-world data and is particularly useful in the presence of dynamical or observational noise.

```@docs
permentropy
```

For example, we will compute and compare the [`lyapunov`](@ref) exponent of the logistic
map with the order-6 permutation entropy, like in the original paper.
```@example entropy
using DynamicalSystems, PyPlot
ds = Systems.logistic()
rs = 3.5:0.001:4
ls = Float64[]; hs = Float64[]
for r in rs
    ds.p[1] = r
    push!(ls, lyapunov(ds, 100000))
    # For 1D systems `trajectory` returns a vector
    push!(hs, permentropy(trajectory(ds, 10000), 6))
end

f = figure(figsize = (10,6))
a1 = subplot(211)
plot(rs, ls); ylim(-2, log(2)); ylabel("\$\\lambda\$")
a1[:axes][:get_xaxis]()[:set_ticklabels]([])
xlim(rs[1], rs[end]);

a2 = subplot(212)
plot(rs, hs; color = "C1"); ylabel("\$h_6\$")
xlim(rs[1], rs[end]); xlabel("\$r\$")
tight_layout()
savefig("permentropy.png"); nothing # hide
```

!!! info "Permutation Entropy performance"
    Even though the current implementation is fine and runs reasonably fast for
    moderate orders, it can get slow for high orders. Issue [ChaosTools.jl#22](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/ChaosTools.jl/issues/22)
    keeps track of this, and contains information on how to improve performance.

## Attractor Dimension Estimation
There are numerous methods that one can use to calculate a so-called "dimension" of a
dataset, like for example the [Fractal dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_dimension). This real number can offer
a lot of information about the object that the dataset represents.

### Generalized Dimensions
Based on the definition of the [generalized entropy](#ChaosTools.genentropy), one can calculate an appropriate
dimension, called *generalized dimension*:
```@docs
generalized_dim
```
---
!!! danger "Be wary when using `generalized_dim`"
    As stated clearly by the documentation string, calling `generalized_dim` performs a lot of automated steps by calling other functions (see below)
    with default arguments. It is actually more like a convenient bundle than
    an actual function and therefore you should be careful
    when considering the validity of the returned number.

```@docs
estimate_boxsizes
linear_regions
linear_region
```
---

#### Example
For example, the dimension of the strange attractor of the
[Hénon map](system_definition/#DynamicalSystems.Systems.henon) is:
```julia
using DynamicalSystems
hen = Systems.henon()
ts = trajectory(hen, 1000000)
D_hen = information_dim(ts)
```
```
1.2279316105815665
```

As a side note, be sure that you have enough data points, otherwise the values you will
get will never be correct, as is demonstrated by
J.-P. Eckmann and D. Ruelle (see Physica D **56**, pp 185-187 (1992)).

### Kaplan-Yorke Dimension
```@docs
kaplanyorke_dim
```
---
Notice that calling this function requires you to pass the Lyapunov exponents in an
ordered vector form (largest to smallest). Example:
```@example lyap
using DynamicalSystems
hen = Systems.henon()
D_kp = kaplanyorke_dim(lyapunovs(hen, 100000))
```
